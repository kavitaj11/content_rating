             React is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, especially for single-page applications (SPAs). It allows you to build components that can manage their own state and be composed into complex UIs.

A typical React app involves:

Components: Reusable building blocks that render UI.

JSX: A syntax extension that looks like HTML but allows you to embed JavaScript code.

State & Props: State represents data that can change over time, while props are passed from parent to child components to share data.

React Router: For navigation and handling different views in a single-page app.

Hooks: Functions like useState, useEffect, etc., that allow you to use state and other React features in functional components.

                 Like ({this.state.likes})
               </button>
               <button className="dislike-button" onClick={this.state.handleDislike}>
                 Dislike ({this.state.dislikes})
               </button>
